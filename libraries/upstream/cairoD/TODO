* Properties vs. functions. Cairo binding docs suggest not to use properties instead of functions
  as new overloads might be added later. Still some function make a lot more sense as properties  
  (cairo.ps.PSSurface.setEPS)?
* Error handling might be to conservative in some cases. Some scope(exit) checkError(); might not be
  necessary
* Streaming output (cairo_*_surface_create_for_stream) is not implemented. Needs new streaming
  model from phobos
* Missing surfaces: At least
    + cairo-drm.h
    + cairo-gl.h (with Derelict)
    + cairo-qt.h
    + cairo-quartz.h
    + cairo-skia.h
    + cairo-vg.h
* Split Win32Surface in CAIRO_SURFACE_TYPE_WIN32_PRINTING and CAIRO_SURFACE_TYPE_WIN32 surface?
* For scopes which cannot throw Exceptions, scope(exit) checkError(); is overkill. Rewrite those
* Finish Font support:
    + FreeType Fonts (FontConfig)
    + Quartz Fonts
    + User Fonts
    + Pango?
* Regions
