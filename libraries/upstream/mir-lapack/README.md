# mir-lapack
NDSLICE wrapper for LAPACK

mir-lapack assumes that matrixes are passed in the transposed form.
Each (contiguous) row in a mir's matrix should store a (contiguous) column of a Fortran matrix.

## Required system libraries

See [wiki: Link with CBLAS & LAPACK](https://github.com/libmir/mir-lapack/wiki/Link-with-CBLAS-&-LAPACK).
